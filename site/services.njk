questions:
  - question: Once you build my site, can I update it?
    answer: Yes! You will have a content management tool that allows you to update the content on your site. You could do things like create a new page for your new book, upload a new painting, or edit your bio. After it's built, you won't be able modify the design of your site (font, color, layout) without help from us, or another a web developer.
  - question: What if I wanted to use a different service to host my website once it's built?
    answer: We'll give you all the code for your site, so you could do whatever you want with it. 
  - question: Can't I just use Squarespace, Wix, or a similar service?
    answer: Yes! These services are cool because you can modify the layouts and design by yourself without knowing how to write code. But, this work can still take a lot of time and effort. And, unfortunately, you will be paying a monthly fee for as long as your site is around, and you may have to use templates or "stock" features that aren't exactly what you want. In most cases, your Hush Spring site will be more peformant, accessible, and SEO friendly than a site built with these other tools. 
  - question: You say that my site will be fast, accessible, and SEO friendly. How will I know that it actually is?
    answer: We can show you how to use a tool called Lighthouse, from Google. It will you show you scores for web performance, accessibility, and SEO. They will be very high.
